# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in the s 
s = {8, 7, 12, "Aaryan", [8,12]}

#NOTE:
'''
NO,you cannot change the value inside a list cantained in a set in python.
In fact ,you cannot have a list as an element in a set because sets in Python require all their 
elements to be immutable and hashable.Lists are mutable and not hashable,so they cannot be all as a set
